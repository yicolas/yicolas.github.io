## About

I am a geologist currently pursuing a PhD at Caltech using field observation, paleomagnetism, geochemistry, geochronology and petrology to better develop our understanding of igneous intrusions, meteorite impacts and Earth's magnetic field.

## Field Work

**Iquitos, Peru** (2023)

**Barstow, CA** (2023)

**Cobalt, ON, Canada**  
Used paleomagnetic studies to develop a model of the timing of folding and carbonate vein intrusion associated with 5-element vein deposits for economic geology.

**Columbia River Gorge, OR**  
Investigated post-rainstorm, fire-prone, high-slope regions to better quantify debris flow quantity and frequency along high-risk Columbia River Gorge catchments. Scouted for potential landing zones for 1m resolution drone LIDAR.

**Point Lobos, CA**  
Determined the relationship, tectonic history, and post-deposition deformation between outcropping Salinian igneous rock and the overlying sediment using field relationships and sedimentary lithofacies stratigraphic sections.

**Benton, CA**  
Large scale mapping of the Benton Range to constrain the tempo of dike emplacement and subsequent tectonic folding as it pertains to crustal stresses and magmatism associated with the Nevadan orogeny along Laurentia's western coastline.

**Mono, CA**  
Surficial glacial geomorphology mapping to characterize landscape evolution and extent of glaciation since the LGM. Slope surveys of fault scarps of well-dated Sierran moraines to determine average rate and direction of slip for Hilton Creek Fault since the LGM.

**Death Valley, CA**  
Field mapping, section measurement, and sample collection to develop stratigraphic, geochronologic and paleomagnetic data for Southwestern Laurentia large igneous province.

## Education

### California Institute of Technology – Pasadena, CA
**Graduate Student – Geology and Planetary Science** (2023 – Present)

Using field observation, paleomagnetism, geochemistry, geochronology, and petrology to better develop our understanding of igneous intrusions, magma evolution and Earth's magnetic field.

**Projects:**
1. Paleomagnetism of Lao Basalt Flows and their relationship with the Australasian Impactor
2. Rapid Polar Wander of North America During the Early Cambrian: Paleomagnetic and magnetostratigraphic constraints from the Cerro Rajón Volcanics of Caborca, Mexico, and the Tapeats Sandstone and Bright Angel Shale of the Grand Canyon, Arizona
3. Magnetostratigraphic dating of lagerstätten Miocene sediments from the Peruvian Amazon
